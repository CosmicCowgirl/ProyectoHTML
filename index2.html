            <h2>A New Lunar Far Side Radio Telescope Is Ready For Testing</h2>
            <h3>By Andy Tomaswick - July 29, 2025 11:41 AM UTC | Missions</h3>
            <p>
              We’ve been talking about sending a radio telescope to the far side of the Moon for awhile now. Now that reality is one step closer with the completion of the design and construction phase of the Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment-Night (LuSEE-Night) radio telescope project. This milestone marks a major step in the development of the system, which is planned to launch on a lunar lander in 2026.

Any radio telescope on the far side of the Moon will have plenty of advantages over any radio telescopes within sight of Earth, since the lunar far side is the one place in the solar system that isn’t ever affected by radio noise coming from the Earth itself. That isolation allows it to search for faint signals from the early universe, such as the coveted “Dark Ages” signal that emanates from when the universe was only 380,000 years old, before planets and stars were formed.

Radio interference from Earth typically drowns out the Dark Ages signal, which is why a radio telescope on the far side of the Moon, which is protected from that interference by the Moon’s mass, is so appealing. Unfortunately, that also means any equipment sent there has to contend with the harsh environment on the lunar surface, which includes not only massive amounts of radiation, but massive temperature swings of over 300 C.
